# Encryption_Decryption_Algorithm_JAVA
## Introduction
In cryptography, encryption is a vital technique used to secure sensitive information.
This project demonstrates two historical encryption methods: the Caesar Cipher and the Bellaso Cipher.
Modern standards no longer consider these methods secure and should not be used for real-world applications.

### Caesar Cipher

 The Caesar Cipher is a basic substitution cipher where a character replaces each character in the plaintext with a fixed offset. 
It is named after Julius Caesar, who used this method to protect his messages.

### Bellaso Cipher
The Bellaso Cipher, devised by Giovan Battista Bellaso, uses a keyword to determine the character offsets for encryption and decryption. 
This keyword wraps around as needed, making it more complex than the Caesar Cipher.

## Project Components
This Java project involves:
* Implementing the Caesar Cipher and Bellaso Cipher encryption and decryption algorithms.
* Utilizing loops and string/character processing.
* Working with ASCII codes.
